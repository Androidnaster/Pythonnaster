<p> <i>  Welcome to our first
     tutorial on Python.Recently
     I provided an intriguing intro into 
     the wonderful world of programming.
     In particular the popular and developed
      language of Python.
      I will provide programs 
      to strictly Pynaster members only.
      Which means you are a member as you
       can access this wonderful page.</i></p>
       <hr>
       <h2>Let's get on it</h2>
     <i>  what you will need:</i>
    <div> <b>*an IDE(integrated development enviroment)
     .I suggest you take a
      good look at my guide
       on tools to use</b></div>
     <div>  <b>*an android device or your pc.</b>
     </div>
     <hr>
   <h2> Let's begin on data types</h2>
  <p> Data types are a very common thing you will 
   be most likely be dealing with on python.I assure 
   you that there will be no program that will not 
   include data types.</p>
   
 <hr>
 <h3>The common data 
 types you would be
  dealing with</h3>
  
  <hr>
  <hr>
  <div><b>int</b>-any interger (either"+" or "-")</div>
  <hr>
   <div><b>strings</b>-these involves plain text</div>
  <hr>
   <div><b>floats</b>-these are int and decimal numbers</div>
  <hr>
  <hr>
 <p> Below is a the most basic program 
  that has a string</p>
  
  
 <br></br>
 <hr>
 <i>print("Hello World")</i>
 <hr>
 
<p> This is why I love Python, 
 it is fairly easy to learn.
 What you have seen above is a program
  that commands a computer in a language 
  it can understand .This program tells the 
  computer to say  <i>Hello World</i></p>
  
 <hr>
 Now a program that has intergers
<br></br>

<div> <i> x=3 </i> </div>

<div> <i> y=7 </i> </div

<i>result=int(x)+int(y)</i>

<div><i>print("result")</i></div>
<hr>
this program is going 
to spit out the addition of <b>x</b> and<b> y
</b>
which is equal to 10

<hr>
And lastly a program that 
will add/subtract/devide/multiply integers and floats
<hr>

<div> <i> x=2.5 </i> </div>

<div> <i> y=7.5 </i> </div>

<i>result=float(x)+float(y)</i>

<div><i>print("result")</i></div>
<hr>
<h2>
Pynaster tip</h2>
<div>The sign of multiplication is (*)</div>

<div>The sign of subtraction is (-)</div>

<div>The sign of devision is (/)</div>


<div>The sign of addition is (+)</div>

   <div></div>
  <p>This all for data types,the next tutorial will be about variables </p>
   <div></div>
