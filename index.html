                   Computer programming
                   languages allow us to give
                   instructions to a computer
                   in a language the computer 
                   understands.
            <br><br>
                   The portion of the 
                   language that a computer 
                   can understand is called a <i>
                   binary.
                </i> Translating programming 
                   language into binary is known as 
                 <i>compiling</i>.
            <br><br>
                   Each language,
                   from C Language to Python,
                   has its own distinct features, 
                   though many times there are
                   commonalities between  programming
                   languages.
            <br><br>
                   There are dozens of programming

                   I have compiled an overview
                   of a language that I think  would be 
                   helpful in the introduction to computer
                   programming as it is very easy to learn
                   and most languages are based on this specific one .

          Python is an advanced
          programming language that
          is interpreted, object-oriented 
          and built on flexible and 
          robust semantics.

<h2>WHERE DID IT START?</h2>
<hr>

Python was developed in
 the late 1980s at CWI in
  the Netherlands and first
   released to the public in 1991.

<h1>
Tools to run Python on Android
</h1>
<hr>
Python has proven itself 
as a highly capable  languageâ€Š
 for newcomers, 
but powerful in the hands of experts.
 Why <i>should not </i>you be able to use 
 Python everywhere that you need to 
 tell a computer to do something?
  And<i> should not</i> your tools exploit 
  all the capabilities of Python 
  as a language, not just the bits
   that map nicely to a C binding?
<br><br>
Modern computing<i> does not only </i>happen
 in an 80x25 console window.
  It happens on phones, tablets, and 
  desktop machines with rich user
   interfaces. <i>Should you not</i>  be able 
   to use Python in all those locations, 
   and exploit the unique capabilities of 
   those platforms?

<br><br>
End users <i>should not</i> have
 to care what language 
 their tools are written in. 
 And that starts with looking 
 and behaving like completely 
 native tools. Native appearance,
  native behavior, delivered in the 
  way a native app is delivered.
   Why <i>should not </i>your Python tools 
   fit in just as well as a native tool?
   
   <br><br>
  There are 
  a couple of unique ways to
   use Python on Android.
   <hr>
   <h1>1.pyqtdeploy</h1>
   <hr>
   <img src="PyQtdeploy.png" width="300" height="200">
    Pyqtdeploy is a tool 
   for deploying PyQt applications. 
   It supports deployment to desktop
    platforms (Linux, Windows and OS X)
     and to mobile platforms (iOS and
      Android).
   <br><br>
  pyqtdeploy works by
    taking the individual 
    modules of a PyQt application,
     freezing them, and then placing 
     them in a Qt resource file that 
     is converted to C++ code by <i>Qts 
     rcc tool.</i><i> Pythons </i>standard library
      is handled in the same way.
   
<br><br>
pyqtdeploy also generates a <i>Qt pro</i> file 
that describes all the generated C++ code.
 From this<i> Qts</i> qmake tool is used to generate
  a <i>platform specific </i>Makefile which will
   then generate a single executable. Further 
   Qt <i>and or</i>platform specific tools can then
    be used to 
   convert the executable to a platform specific 
   deployable package.
   <br><br>
pyqtdeploy requires PyQt5 and 
Python v3.2 or later to be installed.
   <br><br>
PyQt4 and PyQt5 applications
 written using Python v2.6 and 
 later and Python v3.3 and later 
 are supported.
<br><br>
pyqtdeploy is released under
 the BSD license.

  <h1>2.Qpython
<hr>
<img src="QPython.jpg" width="300" height="200">
</h1>

QPython is an
 <i>on device </i>script 
 engine and development 
 environment.

<!--insert qpythons logo-->
In most cases, script can get your
 jobs done as good as the native 
 application. Now you can make 
it with QPythons help.
  
  QPython is a 
  script engine 
  which runs Python
   programs on 
  android devices. 
  It also can help
   developers 
  develop android 
  applications.
  
  QPython includes a complete 
  development kit which help you 
  to develop programs with mobile 
  provides regular Python console
  <hr>
  <h1>3.Termux</h1>
  <hr>
  <!--insert Termux logo-->
  
  
  <hr>
Termux is an
 Android terminal
  emulator and Linux
   environment app that 
   works directly with no 
   rooting or setup required. 
   A minimal base system is installed.
Additional packages 
    are available using the APT package
     manager.
     
     Although 
    <i> Androids </i>primary 
     programming language is Java, 
     there is no known port of Python
      to the platform. Android support 
      in BeeWare is achieved using VOC,
       a tool that compiles Python source
        code to Java class files.
         This allows Python code to be 
         executed as a native binary on 
         the JVM.
